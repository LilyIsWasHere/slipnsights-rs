# SLP Conversion Detection Using Peppi-rs (Very WIP)

## How to run:

### Place a .slp replay file in the replays directory (Has only been tested with 1v1 games at the moment)
### Run 'cargo run --release' in the main directory (first compile will be slow)
### See the comment on line 155 of main.rs for more detailed output
